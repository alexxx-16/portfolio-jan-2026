<hr />

<h3 style="color: lightseagreen;">We're the Millers</h3>
<p>A really lighthearted movie full of hilarious moments that will definitely make anyone's day.</p>

<h3 style="color: lightseagreen;">Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Possibly my favourite movie by Hayao Miyazaki. It shows a world of imagination and mysteries that's just mindblowing. The storyline is also very sweet. </p>

<h3 style="color: lightseagreen;">The Twilight Saga</h3>
<p>One of my all time go to movie series ever since I was a teenager.</p>
